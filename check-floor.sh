# Reports what a finished client demands of the system it will run on, and fails
# if it demands more than it was allowed to. One script for all three platforms,
# because the question is the same everywhere and only the place to read the
# answer differs:
#
#   ELF     the highest glibc version referenced   readelf -V
#   Mach-O  the deployment target                  vtool -show-build
#   PE      the DLLs and functions it imports      objdump -p
#
# Linux is the only one of the three with no way to declare that floor in the
# build; it falls out of the distribution one builds on. Hence this script: what
# cannot be stated has to be measured.
#
# Reading works across architectures -- readelf parses ELF directly instead of
# going through a target backend -- so an armhf client can be checked on an x86
# machine, which is what the arm job does.
#
# Usage:
#   ./check-floor.sh <binary> <floor> [--armv6-hardfloat]
#
#   ./check-floor.sh tool/avr-gdb 2.35
#   ./check-floor.sh tool/avr-gdb 2.31 --armv6-hardfloat
